# Theme Switcher Web App

Welcome to the **Theme Switcher App** â€” a simple React project that lets you switch between three different themes: Light, Dark, and Colorful. Each theme not only changes colors, but also transforms the layout, spacing, fonts, and overall structure of the app.

- Uses Redux Toolkit to manage the selected theme globally.
- Each theme has a unique layout, font sizes, spacing, and colors.
- Built using React Router, CSS Modules, and reusable layout components.
- Fully responsive design.
- Smooth transitions when switching themes.
